  Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe!
  Cause explosive decompression! Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.
</p>
<p>
  That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms
  McKenzie! <strong> Come, Comrade Bender!</strong> <em> We must take to the streets!</em> We'll need to have a look inside
  you with this camera.
</p>
<h2>So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?</h2>
<p>
  Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting
  naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies.

    Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for
    violence?

    The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house
    of cards. Checkmate.

<h3>Shinier than yours, meatbag.</h3>

  What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! Hello, little man. I will destroy you! We're
  also Santa Claus! It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense,
  that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.

  <li>In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.</li>
  <li>Of all the friends I've had… you're the first.</li>
  <li>With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!</li>

<p>
  With gusto. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? Is the Space
  Pope reptilian!? You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?
</p>
<p>
  Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! Who
  are those horrible orange men? You know, I was God once. No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't
  own!
</p>
<p>
  File not found. Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big
  and evil! Ours is small and neutral! Ummm…to eBay?
</p>
<p>
  Shut up and get to the point! No. We're on the top. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna
  be right. One hundred dollars.
</p>
<p>
  Anyone who laughs is a communist! Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. We're rescuing ya. But I've never
  been to the moon!
</p>
<p>
  Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Good news, everyone! There's a report on
  TV with some very bad news! So, how 'bout them Knicks? That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If
  I could just learn to play this stupid thing.
</p>
<p>
  Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? Ask her how her day was. Hey, you add a one and two
  zeros to that or we walk! I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean
  the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually?
</p>
<p>And I'm his friend Jesus. Say what? Now what? You are the last hope of the universe.</p>
<p>
  Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Bender, you risked your life to save me!
  That's the ONLY thing about being a slave.
</p>
<p>
  Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. We're also Santa Claus! You
  know, I was God once. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. That's the ONLY thing about being a slave.
</p>
<p>
  Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is
  intelligent. Dissect its brain! Ow, my spirit! Your best is an idiot! Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!
